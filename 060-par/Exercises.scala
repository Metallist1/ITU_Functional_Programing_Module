  // Exercise 3
  
  /* Write the answer here in a comment:
   * Test case is a a collection of test steps, expected results and data. 
   * Before we even consider testing we must define map and its functionality.
   * Our map function should take some Par[A] and remap its functionality to Par[B] given a series of instructions.
   * Map utalises map 2 which means that one side of the map will contain the list and all the values stored in it and the other will pass a no-op.
   * Par should not be evaluated for map to remap a value.
   * 
   * When designing test cases there is several methodologies you can follow. Which depends on what result we want to test and achieve. In this case we will focus on concurrency:
   * We will test for normal execution, upper and lower boundries (values that normally would not make sense to execute, but are possible) and incorrect upper and lower boundry values.
   * (values that should not produce results or make no sense.)
   * Thus, firstly we should simply pass a list of integers wrapped in Par from 0 to x and try to remap them to  _ + 1. We would create an another list start from 1 to x + 1 and wrap it in Par.
   * We then would compare the result from the map with the result of our second list. If it matches. The test would be sucessful.
   * Other test we would do : Pass and Empty list and map it to true. Pass a full list of values and map it to false and so on. 
   * for testing concurrency: We would check if the map does not force it to computate (we are mutating the value, not computing it). We would check if the map runs in parallel... ect.

  /* Write your explanation in English here:
   * Our approach uses recursion to divide work into small chunks.
   * Once we split divide the work, each half will call wget method recursively. 
   * This call will be wrapped in Par and will be unevaluated and will wait to be evaluated in a seperate thread.
   * Once we reach the smallest available chunk. We will call an time expensive method "fromURL" or we will return and empty list if there is no uris.
   * Lastly, we will now evaluate what each half of the split uris contains by running it in parallel using an executor service.
   * By executing both threads in parallel we do it concurrently 
   * Once evaluated, we finally concattinate both lists and output the result.

Explain briefly in English why all three of these extensions cannot be placed in the same extension
block? Why they cannot be put in the same block with extensions for Par[A]?
*/

/* Write your answer in English here:

 * In each of the three extension methods we need a diffrent type of Par value to execute them successfully.
 * In Join method, when we run Par, we need to get Par[A]. In ChoiceN, we need to get Int and in choice we need to get boolean.
 * If we would place all of them inside the same extension, we will get a type error each of the methods require a diffrent type to execute their instructions.
 * If we would place all of them in the same block with extensions for Par[A]. We would encounter the same issue as Par[A] would produce value A.
 * A != Int, Boolean or Par[A] thus a type error would be thrown.
 * 
 */

/* An example answer:
 *
 * The three above extension cannot be a part of the same module
 * extension, because they extend different types, respectively:
 * Par[Par[A]], Par[Int], and Par[Boolean]. For the same reason they
 * cannot be part of the extension of Par[A], as each of them requires
 * an object of a more specific type.
